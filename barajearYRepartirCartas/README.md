## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code.
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

You can create a `lib` to add dependencies
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Commands to compile and execute:
```sh
javac -d bin/ src/barajaryrepartecartas/BarajarYReparteCartas.java
java -cp bin/ barajaryrepartecartas.BarajarYReparteCartas
```

> If you want to customize the folder structure and you write Java code in VS code, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
