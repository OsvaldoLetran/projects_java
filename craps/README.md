## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

You can create a `lib` folder to add libraries.
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Commands to compile and execute:
```sh
javac -d bin/ craps2021/Craps2021.java
java -cp bin/ craps2021.Craps2021
```

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
